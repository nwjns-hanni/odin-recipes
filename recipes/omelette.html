        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Creating the perfect Omelette has never been this easy! All you need is a nice non-stick pan and a handful of eggs. Don't forget to get some vegetables and cheese on there to make oh so perfect!</p>
        <p> If you want to impress your favorite bias from your favorite group then let's get started</p>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of milk</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li> 2 tbsp of Butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
            <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>

        </ol>
